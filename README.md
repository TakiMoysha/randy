## Cheezeburgerz!
Conky was named after the puppet... so this thing is Randy

## Building
### Optional deps / features
By default Randy turns on support for getting temp from NVidia cards via NVML shared objects and CPU temps via lm-sensors.

You can disable these by simply building with `--no-default-features`

### Required build packages
I have only barely looked into packaging but [jhjaggars](https://github.com/jhjaggars) put some helpful hints for Raspbian and Fedora in here:
* https://github.com/iphands/randy/issues/2
* https://github.com/iphands/randy/issues/1

### Example
```shell
cargo run --release --no-default-features  # build with lm-sensors and nvml disabled
```
